## Introduction
**Biobanks** are increasingly playing an important role in biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical research. The ability to manage an ever-increasing number of biosamples (blood, tissue, DNA etc.) and to comply with the regulatory requirements, such as HTA, GCLP, MHRA, FDA 21  CFR Part 11 and other similar requirements, is a high priority for all organisations working in this area.  

**Biobank Management Systems** are frequently built from **Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS)**, but need to be configured to deliver a solution that meets the specific requirements in a clearly understandable way. Biobanks can handle a wide range of sample types. In addition to the more traditional collections of human tissues biobanks, there are also collections of animal tissues or botanical samples.

**Charleston Park** is a dialog-based application performing the management of data of the patients with cardiovascular disease. The data includes patient basic information, sample information and imaging information of cardiology.

Furthermore, I use relational database to combine all sorts of patient's information together, so that the scability of can be achieved during our clinical practice.
